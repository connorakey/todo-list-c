# Simple To-Do List in C

A simple terminal based to-do list written entirely in C



## Features

- Adding Tasks
- Removing Tasks
- Viewing Tasks

## Differences
Unlike a Javascript To-Do list written on the web, this one is compiled by you, in your terminal compatiable with any operating system (as long as it can compile C)

This To Do list does not save and fully removes all data when exitted.




## Installation

Install the To Do list

Linux:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/connorakey/todo-list-c
  cd todo-list-c
  make
```

Windows:
```powershell
  git clone https://github.com/connorakey/todo-list-c
  cd todo-list-c
  gcc -o main main.c
```

Mac:
```zsh
  git clone https://github.com/connorakey/todo-list-c
  cd todo-list-c
  clang -o main main.c
```

It is recommmened you install with Linux since the make file has some tiny optimizations, that likely won't matter at all on a code base of ~120 lines
